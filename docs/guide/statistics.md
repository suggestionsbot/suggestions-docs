# Statistics

::: tip
Logging of approved/rejected status of suggestions began on September 29, 2018. Any data before that *specifically* regarding the status of a suggestion is not logged. However, suggestion data in general, in the new database, has been logged. This explains the gap between approved/rejected suggestions and the total number of suggestions in your guild if you have had this bot in your guild for some time.
:::

There are two different commands you can use to get the statistics of suggestions in your guild:

* `suggestions`
* `sid`
* `mysuggestions`

The `suggestions`command allows you to view the total number of suggestions in your guild as well as how many suggestions have been approved or rejected \(read the message above\):

The `sid`command allows you to view the information of a specific suggestion via their suggestion ID \(sID\). You can do this with `sid <id>`:

Similar to when a suggestion is approved or rejected, the message embed will change to indicate how that suggestion was handled:

The `mysuggestions` command allows you to view the number of suggestions you submitted in a guild and the number that were approved/rejected. You can also see the sID of your most recent suggestion. You can view it just like above using the `sid` command.

This is not where it stops! There will be more ways in the future to view even more information for suggestions. Both for users and staff members.
